Welcome to blairmunroakusa LEAF level!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. This organization helps organize my world piece computer.

. LEAF is where I keep repositories that are *specific*.

. (ROOT level is my personal account, blairmunroakusa.)

. (TRUNK level contains my *general* repositories.)

. (BRANCH level contains my *topical* repositories.)

. This is how I nest repos without making a royal mess.

. For you, the purpose of this level is to give you freedom to clone
	. several related modules within the same space/framework,
	. or just a single specific project.

. Navigation links are at the top of each repo README.

Thanks for stopping by,

I hope you find something in the trail of chaos and creation.
