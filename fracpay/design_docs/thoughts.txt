. rent is too expensive... I cannot justify CITE accounts, or even connected REF accounts

. the 'all new accounts must be rent-exempt' bit is bothering me
. perhaps I need to use a framework like anchor to save on time/pain

. so rent is by size (expected) thus concern now is tx fee for one acct per piece
. 1kB rent-exempt is basically a dollar
. damn that's fucked. 10MB (max) is 69 SOL for rent-exemption
. 15kB exe costs 13$ right now for rent-exemption ... ew
. perhaps a single account for on node could work
. rent may be a problem for current envisioned architecture

. woah, spl-token-cli has a LOT of rust crates (468)
. pretty sure I already intalled the solana tool suite
. I wonder if I will want to create NFTs out of each content piece
. damn, SOLdev is a sweet resource
