LETTER TO POTENTIAL INVESTORS:

Hello, my name is Blair Munro of Anchorage, Alaska --  peacenut, inventor, boss.

I write because I really need help, and I do not know how to find it. (ie, I do not know any venture capitalists/digital philanthropists.)

TL;DR, I need between 5 and 10 million dollars seed funding to afford the seed phase of the world piece computer invention project. Specifically, this means funding requisitions for a team, business overhead, plus access to advisors, for the purpose of implementing a novel payment dApp that I am writing for the Solana blockchain. Between 5 and 10 years, I expect this venture to expand into a 10-100B$ web4 enterprise. By 20 years, I believe the overall project vision will easily command >1 quadrillion dollars in real and digital assets, both fungible, non-fungible, and human. This will usher in the advent of web5, a peace-based distributed/decentralized computational network comprised of world piece computers.

_Referring to the work of Jaron Lanier, if we are to solve any of our largescale tangible and intangible social problems, we must start by creating a digital Humanistic information economy capable of incentivizing the valuation of Human worth. He refers to this as a **digital humanistic information economy**, and this is what the payment app is poised to initiate._
