INTRO
Projects like this are heavy, slippery objects. Much like the challenge, to pick a gold brick up with your bare hands WITHOUT sliding it off the table, projects like this are *nearly* impossible to pull off (esp with brains like mine). But that's any project like this, and people do it all the time. So this guide is more about providing an example of one such project, with emphasis on the creative process, not the actual resultant referenance implementation (something past me always pines for). The reason this post is tagged as ADVANCED, is because the product was created by an AMATEUR MASTER, and I have no way of guaranteeing the quality of my offering, thus it would behoove you to know what you're doing to take my reference to heart. So that's the challenge, in the spirit of a creative process reference. If you are INTERMEDIATE, can you level up on criticize my work? If you are BEGINNER, can you follow what I am doing from prior reference implementations, without my dole? If you are ADVANCED, can you empathize with my architecture, then critique it without being an asshole?
