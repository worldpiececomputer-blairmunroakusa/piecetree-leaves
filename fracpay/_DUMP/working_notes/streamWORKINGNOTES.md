So, programmatically, an account is just a serialized struct. (from hello world)

Ok, that was a lot of reading.

I need to spend some time collecting reference implementations. There are a lot, so it may be difficult to stay focused.

I think first I am going to just scour soldev and make a list of what's there.

But first what is Anchor -  anchor is a framework for solanas 'Sealevel runtime' that makes devs life easier.

Implemtation refs, by tag:

I need to get setup and I need to yank the escrow program reference implementation from solana web:

[https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/](https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/)

For setup, I need to get situated with the CLI. PATH echo says I should be in business, but bash doesn't recognize 'solana'.

Ok just needed to reinstall and update PATH. Now I am looking at the token program command line utility. Installing the rust crates now and there are a lot. 

It looks like I am all set up for now.

Procrastinating...reading aimlessly through escrow example...already been here.
